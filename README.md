A native custom integration for Home Assistant to connect directly to a SIP server or PBX (such as FreePBX, Asterisk, or any VoIP provider). It exposes the telephone line as a native media player, allows DTMF control, provides an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu engine, and bridges calls directly to Home Assistant's Voice Assist.

## Features & Platforms

- **Native Media Player Entity**: Exposes the SIP line as a `media_player` entity. Stream standard TTS messages (e.g. Google Translate, Piper, Nabu Casa) or audio URLs directly into the active SIP call.
- **Browser Two-Way Audio** *(new)*: Hear the caller through your browser and speak back using your microphone — no host speakers or PulseAudio required.  Includes a custom Lovelace card (`sip-call-card`) that streams live Opus/WebM audio from the caller and captures your microphone audio via `getUserMedia()`.
- **Custom Telephony Services**: Complete set of services to control SIP calls (`sip.dial`, `sip.hangup`, `sip.answer`, `sip.send_dtmf`, `sip.start_recording`, `sip.stop_recording`, `sip.start_assist`).
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Engine**: Construct nested DTMF automated phone trees with TTS prompt templates, custom PIN authentication, and native Home Assistant service triggers.
- **Voice Assist Integration**: Bidirectional audio streaming between the SIP call and Home Assistant's Voice Assist pipeline, utilizing active 8kHz to 16kHz resampling.
- **Sensors**: Exposes real-time registration status, call state (line active), and last caller ID.

## Installation

1. **HACS**: Add this repository (`eigger/hass-sip`) to HACS as a custom repository, or 
   **Manual**: Copy the `custom_components/sip` directory into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Browser Two-Way Audio (Live Call Card)

When a SIP call is active, hass-sip exposes a live Opus/WebM audio stream of the caller's voice via an HTTP endpoint, and accepts browser microphone audio via a companion POST endpoint.  A custom Lovelace card (`sip-call-card`) ties these together for a complete browser-based telephone experience.

### Requirements

- **ffmpeg with `libopus`**: The integration transcodes 8 kHz PCM → Opus/WebM on the fly.  Most HA OS / Supervised installs include this already.  Verify with `ffmpeg -encoders 2>&1 | grep libopus`.
- **HTTPS or localhost**: `getUserMedia()` (mic capture) is only available on secure origins.  If your HA frontend is served over HTTP (not localhost), the mic button will not work.  Use the HA cloud (Nabu Casa) or set up a local certificate.

### Adding the Lovelace card

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Resources** (⋮ menu in the top right).
2. Click **Add resource**, set URL to `/sip/static/sip-call-card.js`, type = **JavaScript module**.
3. Reload the page.
4. Add a new card to your dashboard, choose **Custom: SIP Call Card**, and set the `entity` to your SIP media_player entity id:

```yaml
type: custom:sip-call-card
entity: media_player.sip_client_100_phone_line
title: Intercom   # optional
```

### Card usage

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📞 **Answer** | Answers an incoming call (calls `sip.answer`). |
| 📵 **Hang Up** | Ends the current call (calls `sip.hangup`). |
| 🔊 **Listen** | Starts playing the caller's audio in the browser.  Click after answering — required due to browser autoplay policy. |
| 🎤 **Mic On / Mic Off** | Toggles microphone capture.  The browser will prompt for mic permission on the first click.  Your voice is streamed to the caller in ~200 ms chunks. |

### Attributes exposed on the `media_player` entity

While a call is active the entity exposes the following extra attributes that automations or custom cards can use:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `rx_stream_url` | Full URL of the live Opus/WebM audio stream of the caller's voice. |
| `tx_audio_url` | Full URL of the POST endpoint that accepts browser mic audio blobs. |

### Known limitations

- **Single active listener**: Each browser tab that opens the RX stream runs its own ffmpeg transcoder.  Many concurrent listeners will use proportionally more CPU.
- **Latency**: Expect ~300–800 ms end-to-end due to Opus framing and HTTP chunked transfer.  For lower latency, a WebRTC approach would be needed.
- **Mic only where you answered**: The `getUserMedia()` mic capture only works in the specific browser tab/device where the user presses "Mic On".  Other open tabs sharing the same entity don't capture mic input.
- **No simultaneous host speaker + browser audio**: The integration now uses the HTTP stream sink as the primary RX sink.  The host-speaker path (`SpeakerSink` / PulseAudio) is no longer automatically activated alongside the browser stream.  If you still need local speaker output, wire it up manually via a `WavRecorderSink` or the `diagnostic_speakersink.py` script.



## Configuration

Device setup is done entirely through the Home Assistant UI.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **SIP Client**.
3. Fill out the configuration fields:
   - **Server / Host**: IP address or hostname of your SIP server (e.g., FreePBX or Asterisk).
   - **Port**: SIP server port (default: `5060`).
   - **Username**: SIP authentication username/extension.
   - **Password**: SIP authentication password.
   - **Domain** *(Optional)*: SIP Domain/Realm (defaults to Server).
   - **Caller ID** *(Optional)*: Caller display name.
   - **RTP Port** *(Optional)*: Base local RTP port for audio stream (default: `7078`).

## Services

This integration registers the following services under the `sip` domain:

### `sip.dial`
Initiates an outbound SIP call.
- `entity_id` *(Required)*: The target SIP media player entity (e.g. `media_player.phone_line`).
- `number` *(Required)*: The destination number or SIP URI to call (e.g., `100` or `sip:100@freepbx`).
- `ring_timeout` *(Optional)*: Number of seconds to let the call ring before canceling (e.g., `30`).
- `menu` *(Optional)*: IVR menu configuration object (see below).
- `message` *(Optional)*: Text message to speak via TTS upon call connection. If provided without a menu, the call will automatically hang up after speaking. If both `menu` and `message` are provided, `menu` takes precedence and `message` is ignored.
- `tts_engine` *(Optional)*: Specific TTS engine to use (e.g., `tts.google_translate`, `tts.piper`).
- `language` *(Optional)*: Optional language code for TTS (e.g., `ko`, `en`).
- `tts_options` *(Optional)*: Dictionary of extra voice or speech settings (e.g., dynamic parameters).

### `sip.hangup`
Ends an active SIP call or declines an incoming call.
- `entity_id` *(Required)*: The target SIP media player entity.
- `sip_code` *(Optional)*: Optional status code to send if rejecting an incoming call (e.g., `486` for Busy Here).

### `sip.answer`
Answers an incoming SIP call.
- `entity_id` *(Required)*: The target SIP media player entity.
- `menu` *(Optional)*: IVR menu configuration object to start immediately on answer.
- `message` *(Optional)*: Text message to speak via TTS upon answering. If provided without a menu, the call will automatically hang up after speaking. If both `menu` and `message` are provided, `menu` takes precedence and `message` is ignored.
- `tts_engine` *(Optional)*: Specific TTS engine to use (e.g., `tts.google_translate`, `tts.piper`).
- `language` *(Optional)*: Optional language code for TTS.

## Control Entities (Switches & Buttons)

The integration exposes native switch and button entities for easy dashboard control and automation triggers.

### 1. Switches
- **Do Not Disturb Switch** (`switch.phone_line_dnd`): Turn this ON to automatically reject all incoming calls with a `486 Busy Here` SIP response.

### 2. Buttons
- **Answer Button** (`button.phone_line_answer`): Press this button to answer an active incoming call.
- **Hang Up Button** (`button.phone_line_hangup`): Press this button to end the current call or decline an incoming call.

Each button exposes a `can_press` attribute that reflects whether the action applies in the current call state (`answer` → only while a call is ringing in; `hangup` → whenever any call is active). Use it to hide the buttons when they are not actionable:

```yaml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: button.phone_line_answer
    attribute: can_press
    state: true
card:
  type: button
  entity: button.phone_line_answer
  name: Answer
```

---

## Events & Event Entity

The integration fires raw events on the Home Assistant event bus and exposes a native **Event Entity** (`event.phone_line_call_events`) for easier UI-based automations.

### 1. Call Events Entity (Recommended for Automations)
Each SIP extension device includes a **Call Events** entity (e.g. `event.phone_line_call_events`).
You can use this entity as a trigger in the Home Assistant Automation Editor.

Supported event types (`event_type` attribute):
- `incoming`: Fired when an inbound call arrives. Attributes: `caller`, `caller_name`.
- `connected`: Fired when the call is answered.
- `playback_done`: Fired when TTS or audio playback finishes.
- `ended`: Fired when the call ends.
- `dtmf`: Fired when a DTMF key is pressed. Attributes: `digit`.
- `recording_started` / `recording_stopped`: Fired when call recording starts or stops.
- `registered`: Fired when the SIP client registers successfully.

#### Example Event Trigger:
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: event.phone_line_call_events
    attribute: event_type
    to: incoming
```

### 2. Raw Event Bus Events
If you prefer triggering directly from the Event Bus, the integration fires the following events:

| Event | Extra data | Fired when |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `sip_registered` | – | Successfully registered with the PBX |
| `sip_state_changed` | `state` | The SIP line state changes (`idle`, `registering`, `registered`, `inviting`, `ringing_out`, `incoming`, `answering`, `in_call`) |
| `sip_incoming_call` | `caller`, `caller_name` | An inbound call arrives |
| `sip_call_connected` | – | A call becomes two-way connected (use this before playing media) |
| `sip_playback_done` | – | A TTS/audio source has **finished transmitting** to the remote party |
| `sip_call_ended` | – | The call ended (either side hung up) |
| `sip_dtmf_digit` | `digit` | A DTMF digit was received from the remote party |
| `sip_recording_started` | `recording_file` | Call recording started |
| `sip_recording_stopped` | – | Call recording stopped |

> `sip_call_connected` and `sip_playback_done` are the two events/states you want for "answer → speak → hang up" flows: wait for the call to connect before playing media, and wait for playback to finish before hanging up so the message is never cut off.

---

## Example: Announce a TTS message, then hang up

Any standard Home Assistant TTS engine works (Google Translate, Piper, Nabu Casa Cloud, etc.) — the line audio is transcoded with ffmpeg automatically.

There are two ways to announce messages:

### Option A: Simplified Parameters (Recommended)
You can specify the TTS message and settings directly in the `sip.answer` or `sip.dial` service call. The integration will automatically wait for the connection, speak the message, and hang up when finished.

#### Inbound — answer, speak, and hang up automatically
```yaml
alias: "SIP: Announce on incoming call (Simplified)"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: sip_incoming_call
action:
  - service: sip.answer
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
    data:
      message: "Hello, this is an automated response."
      tts_engine: tts.google_translate
      language: en
      # Optional: engine-specific options, e.g. a voice
      # tts_options:
      #   voice: ko-KR-SunHiNeural
```

#### Outbound — dial, speak when answered, and hang up automatically
```yaml
alias: "SIP: Announce on outbound call (Simplified)"
action:
  - service: sip.dial
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
    data:
      number: "100"
      ring_timeout: 30
      message: "A package has been delivered."
      tts_engine: tts.google_translate
      language: en
```

---

### Option B: Multi-step Automation (Advanced)
If you need complex scripting or conditional flows between answering, speaking, and hanging up, you can orchestrate it using Home Assistant events (`sip_call_connected` and `sip_playback_done`).

#### Inbound (Multi-step)
```yaml
alias: "SIP: Announce on incoming call (Multi-step)"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: sip_incoming_call
action:
  - service: sip.answer
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
  # Wait until the call is actually two-way connected
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_call_connected
    timeout: "00:00:10"
  - service: tts.speak
    target:
      entity_id: tts.google_translate
    data:
      media_player_entity_id: media_player.phone_line
      message: "Hello, this is an automated response."
  # Wait until the whole message has been sent (prevents truncation)
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_playback_done
    timeout: "00:00:30"
  - service: sip.hangup
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
```

#### Outbound (Multi-step)
```yaml
alias: "SIP: Announce on outbound call (Multi-step)"
action:
  - service: sip.dial
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
    data:
      number: "100"
      ring_timeout: 30
  # Fires when the remote party answers
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_call_connected
    timeout: "00:00:35"
  - service: tts.speak
    target:
      entity_id: tts.google_translate
    data:
      media_player_entity_id: media_player.phone_line
      message: "A package has been delivered."
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_playback_done
    timeout: "00:00:30"
  - service: sip.hangup
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
```

---

### Option C: Play a media-source TTS URL

If you generate the TTS as a `media-source://tts/...` URL (for example by picking it from the media browser), play it straight to the phone line with `media_player.play_media`. This is handy when you want full control over the TTS entity/voice without the `sip.answer` shortcut.

```yaml
alias: "SIP: Announce via media-source TTS"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: sip_incoming_call
action:
  - service: sip.answer
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
  # Wait until the call is actually two-way connected
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_call_connected
    timeout: "00:00:10"
    continue_on_timeout: false
  - service: media_player.play_media
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
    data:
      media_content_id: >-
        media-source://tts/tts.edge_tts_service_edge_tts?message=안녕하세요&language=ko-KR
      media_content_type: music
  # Wait until the whole message has been sent (prevents truncation)
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: sip_playback_done
    timeout: "00:00:30"
  - service: sip.hangup
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
```

> The `media_content_id` query string is URL-encoded automatically, so you can write a plain (or templated) `message=...`. A plain audio file URL works in place of the `media-source://` id too.

> **Entity IDs:** examples use `media_player.phone_line` as a placeholder. Your actual ids are prefixed with the account, e.g. `media_player.sip_client_100_phone_line` — copy the real one from **Developer Tools → States** (or target the SIP device instead).

---

## IVR Configuration Example

You can pass a menu tree to the `menu` field of `sip.dial` or `sip.answer`. TTS settings use the **same flat field names** as the service parameters (`message`, `tts_engine`, `language`, `tts_options`).

```yaml
service: sip.answer
target:
  entity_id: media_player.phone_line
data:
  menu:
    id: root
    message: "Welcome. Press 1 to toggle the living room light. Press 2 to talk to the Voice Assistant. Or enter your four-digit PIN followed by hash."
    tts_engine: tts.google_translate
    language: en
    wait_for_audio: true
    timeout: 10
    input: digit          # "digit" (single key) or "pin" (multi-key, ends with #)
    choices:
      "1":
        action:
          domain: light
          service: toggle
          entity_id: light.living_room_light
        message: "Toggling the light now."
        post_action: hangup
      "2":
        assist: true        # hand the call to Home Assistant Voice Assist
    on_invalid:
      message: "Invalid selection."
      post_action: repeat   # re-play the current menu
    on_timeout: hangup
```

### Menu fields
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Optional menu id; target for `goto`. |
| `message` | TTS text to speak. |
| `audio_file` | Audio file path/URL to play instead of `message`. |
| `template` | `true` to render `message` as a Jinja template before speaking. |
| `tts_engine` / `language` / `tts_options` | TTS voice settings (same as the service params). |
| `wait_for_audio` | `true` (default): collect input only after playback finishes. |
| `timeout` | Seconds to wait for input (default `10`). |
| `input` | `digit` (default, single key) or `pin` (multi-key, ends with `#`). |
| `choices` | Map of input key → target (nested menu, or a bare `post_action` string). |
| `on_invalid` | Target when the input matches no choice. |
| `on_timeout` | Target when no input arrives in time. |
| `action` | A Home Assistant service to call on entry (`domain`, `service`, `entity_id`, `data`). |
| `assist` | `true` to hand the call to Voice Assist. |
| `post_action` | Terminal action: `hangup` · `repeat` · `back [n]` · `goto <id>` · `wait`. |

## Contacts & Caller ID Mapping

You can map incoming numbers or extensions to friendly names. Create a file named `sip_contacts.json` in your Home Assistant configuration directory (e.g. `/config/` or `/homeassistant/`):

```json
{
  "100": "Dad",
  "101": "Mom",
  "102": {
    "name": "Front Doorbell",
    "auto_answer": true
  }
}
```

If mapped, the `last_call` Friendly Name sensor will display the contact name instead of the raw number. It also exposes a `caller_name` attribute in the `sip_incoming_call` event.

---

## Intercom & Auto-Answer Mode

The integration can automatically answer specific incoming calls (useful for intercoms and doorbells). It triggers in two ways:
1. **SIP Headers**: The incoming call includes standard auto-answer headers like `Call-Info: ...; answer-after=0` or `Alert-Info: Ring Answer`.
2. **Contacts Configuration**: The incoming caller ID matches an extension marked with `"auto_answer": true` in `sip_contacts.json`.

When triggered, the integration answers immediately, opens the audio channel, and bypasses the ringing phase. Auto-answer only opens the channel — pair it with `sip.start_assist`, a TTS `message`, or `sip.start_recording` to actually send or capture audio.

> To answer arbitrary calls under your own conditions, trigger an automation on the `sip_incoming_call` event and call `sip.answer` (optionally with a `message` or `menu`) instead.

---

## Voice Assist Automation Example

You can automatically bridge incoming calls directly to Home Assistant's Voice Assist pipeline:

```yaml
alias: "SIP: Auto-Answer with Voice Assist"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_line_active
    to: "on"
action:
  - service: sip.answer
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
  - service: sip.start_assist
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
```

---

## Intercom Door Release Button Example (DTMF)

If you have a door entry intercom connected to the SIP line (e.g., at the front gate), you can create a Lovelace dashboard button to trigger the gate/door release mechanism. This works by sending a specific DTMF digit (like `1` or `*`) to the active call.

### 1. Basic Dashboard Button Card (YAML)
Add this button configuration to your Home Assistant dashboard:

```yaml
type: button
name: Open Front Gate
icon: mdi:gate
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: sip.send_dtmf
  target:
    entity_id: media_player.phone_line
  data:
    digits: "1" # Digit sequence your gate intercom expects (e.g. 1, *9, etc.)
```

### 2. Conditional Card (Recommended)
To hide the button entirely when there is no call active (preventing accidental triggers), wrap it inside a Conditional Card using the `binary_sensor.phone_line_active` entity:

```yaml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: binary_sensor.phone_line_active
    state: "on"
card:
  type: button
  name: Open Front Gate
  icon: mdi:door-open
  tap_action:
    action: call-service
    service: sip.send_dtmf
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.phone_line
    data:
      digits: "1"
```

---

## Lovelace Dashboard: Recent Calls List Card

You can display a beautiful, dynamically updated call log of the last 20 calls directly on your Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard. This leverages the `call_history` state attribute of the Last Call sensor (`sensor.phone_line_last_call`).

Add a **Markdown Card** to your dashboard with the following YAML template configuration:

```yaml
type: markdown
title: "📞 Recent Calls"
content: >
  <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <thead>
      <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--divider-color); text-align: left;">
        <th style="padding: 8px;">Time</th>
        <th style="padding: 8px;">Caller</th>
        <th style="padding: 8px;">Direction</th>
        <th style="padding: 8px; text-align: right;">Duration</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% set history = state_attr('sensor.phone_line_last_call', 'call_history') %}
      {% if history %}
        {% for call in history %}
          <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--divider-color);">
            <td style="padding: 8px; font-size: 0.9em; color: var(--secondary-text-color);">
              {{ as_timestamp(call.timestamp) | timestamp_custom('%m/%d %H:%M') }}
            </td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">
              <b>{{ call.name }}</b> <span style="font-size: 0.8em; color: var(--secondary-text-color);">({{ call.number }})</span>
            </td>
            <td style="padding: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;">
              {% if call.direction == 'incoming' %}
                {% if call.status == 'answered' %}
                  <span style="color: var(--success-color);">🟢 ↙️ Inbound</span>
                {% elif call.status == 'rejected' %}
                  <span style="color: var(--error-color);">🔴 🚫 Rejected</span>
                {% else %}
                  <span style="color: var(--warning-color);">🟠 ↙️ Missed</span>
                {% endif %}
              {% else %}
                {% if call.status == 'answered' %}
                  <span style="color: var(--info-color);">🔵 ↗️ Outbound</span>
                {% else %}
                  <span style="color: var(--secondary-text-color);">⚪ ↗️ Unanswered</span>
                {% endif %}
              {% endif %}
            </td>

## Voicemail Automation Example

The following automation implements a full voicemail system: when a call is not answered within 15 seconds, it answers, plays a TTS greeting, sounds a beep, records the message to a local file, and sends a mobile notification with the audio clip link:

```yaml
alias: "SIP: Voicemail System"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_line_active
    to: "on"
action:
  # Wait for 15 seconds (ring timeout)
  - delay: "00:00:15"
  # If still ringing, answer and record voicemail
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_line_active
            state: "on"
          - condition: state
            entity_id: media_player.phone_line
            state: "on" # Ringing or not connected yet
        sequence:
          - service: sip.answer
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
          - delay: "00:00:01"
          # Speak a greeting
          - service: media_player.play_media
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
            data:
              media_content_type: "music"
              # Speak TTS using standard HA TTS
              media_content_id: "media-source://tts/tts.google_translate?message=Please+leave+a+message+after+the+beep."
          # Wait for the TTS greeting to finish transmitting (no fixed delay needed)
          - wait_for_trigger:
              - platform: event
                event_type: sip_playback_done
            timeout: "00:00:15"
          # Sound a beep tone (local audio file or url)
          - service: media_player.play_media
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
            data:
              media_content_type: "music"
              media_content_id: "http://local-ip:8123/local/beep.mp3"
          - delay: "00:00:01"
          # Start recording to a local WAV file
          - service: sip.start_recording
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
            data:
              recording_file: "/media/voicemails/last_msg.wav"
          # Record for up to 30 seconds or until they hang up
          - wait_for_trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_line_active
                to: "off"
            timeout: "00:00:30"
          # Stop recording & hang up
          - service: sip.stop_recording
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
          - service: sip.hangup
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.phone_line
          # Push notification to user's phone via Companion App
          - service: notify.notify
            data:
              title: "New Voicemail Received"
              message: "You have a new message from {{ state_attr('sensor.phone_line_last_call', 'last_caller') }}"
              data:
                url: "/media/voicemails/last_msg.wav"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Registration fails**: Double-check the SIP extension credentials and host IP address. Ensure your firewall or FreePBX settings permit UDP traffic on port `5060` from the Home Assistant host.
- **No Audio / One-way Audio**: This is typically caused by NAT or routing issues. Ensure the RTP port range (defaults starting at `7078`) is open and routed properly.
- **FFmpeg errors**: Ensure that the `ffmpeg` system binary is installed and accessible in your Home Assistant path, as it is utilized for audio transcoding.
